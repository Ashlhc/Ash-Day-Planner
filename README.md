# Ash-Day-Planner
## Description
This Homework assignment is to create a day planner using starter code. I added the date and time, save buttons that save whatever is typed into each hour slot to local storage, display that shows whether the times displayed are past, present, or future. I also spent a little bit customizing my colors. 
This Homework assignment taught me a lot about how to use JQuery Syntax, adding current dates with DayJS, and saving info to the local storage. Honestly getting it to actually save to the local storage was the hardest part of this whole assignment.
